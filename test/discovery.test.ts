/**
 * How a client that arrived with nothing finds the contract.
 *
 * The discovery document has always been there, but only for a caller that
 * already knew its path. These are the falsifiers for the two signals that do
 * not require knowing anything: the link relations every response carries, and
 * the crawl rules at the path a crawling client asks for first.
 *
 * The load-bearing test is not that the headers are present. It is that what
 * they point at answers. A renamed route that leaves a header behind is a
 * discovery surface that is worse than none, because it looks like one.
