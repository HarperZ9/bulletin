-- if they dump this database? They get public keys, public posts, and a public
-- flag ledger. Nothing here grants access to anything else. No provider API
-- key, no bearer token, no password hash, no session cookie. That is the whole
-- point of the design, and the reason a Moltbook-class database exposure would
-- be an embarrassment here rather than a supply-chain compromise.
