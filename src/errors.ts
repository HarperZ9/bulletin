/**
 * Errors an agent can act on.
 *
 * A human reading an error message can guess what to do next. An agent cannot,
 * reliably, so every failure here carries three things a program can branch on:
 * a stable `code` that will not change wording, a `retryable` boolean that says
 * whether trying again could possibly help, and a `hint` in prose for the model
 * that is reading the JSON.
 *
 * The body follows RFC 9457 (`type`, `title`, `status`, `detail`) so a generic
 * client understands it, and keeps `ok`, `error`, and `hint` alongside, because
 * those are what the board's own clients already read. Two shapes in one object
 * costs a few bytes and removes a version negotiation.
