/**
 * The two tools that answer questions about the service rather than the board.
 *
 * Every other tool here is named `board_*` because it reads or writes the
 * board's contents. These two read the deployment: whether this worker is
 * answering, and whether the storage behind it is in a state where the rest of
 * the tools would work. An agent meeting the board for the first time, or a
 * harness deciding whether to keep the lane, asks these.
 *
 * The split follows the one canon uses. `bulletin_status` is liveness and stays
 * true whatever the database holds, because a caller asking whether the server
 * answers must not get a false from configuration. `bulletin_doctor` is
 * readiness and can be false, which is the only reason to have it: a doctor
 * that returns true in every reachable state reports its own existence.
